## 🎯 Full Implementation Path

Ready to implement the complete system? Here's your roadmap:

### 📅 Day 1: Database Setup (1 hour)

**What you'll do:**
1. Install MySQL
2. Create database
3. Load schema and data

**Commands:**
```bash
# Create database
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE kjsit_inventory;
EXIT;

# Load schema
mysql -u root -p kjsit_inventory < database/schema.sql

# Load sample data
mysql -u root -p kjsit_inventory < database/data.sql

# Verify
mysql -u root -p kjsit_inventory
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory_items;  # Should show 80+
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;            # Should show 13
```

**Result**: Database with all tables and 80+ items ready!

---

### 📅 Day 2-3: Java Backend Setup (3-4 hours)

**What you'll do:**
1. Install Java JDK and Tomcat
2. Configure database connection
3. Complete remaining servlets
4. Build and deploy

**Detailed steps in**: `java-backend/README-JAVA.md`

**Files you need to complete:**
- `Transaction.java` (model)
- `TransactionDAO.java` (database operations)
- `TransactionServlet.java` (API endpoint)
- `DashboardServlet.java` (statistics)
- `web.xml` (configuration)

**Use the provided files as examples!**

---

### 📅 Day 4: Frontend-Backend Integration (2 hours)

**What you'll do:**
1. Update JavaScript to call real APIs
2. Test all functionality
3. Fix any issues

**Example update** (in `auth.js`):
```javascript
// Replace mock login
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/inventory-management/api/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ username, password, role })
});
```

---

### 📅 Day 5: Testing & Documentation (2 hours)

**What you'll do:**
1. Test all features with real data
2. Fix bugs
3. Prepare presentation
4. Practice demo

---

## 🎓 Understanding the System

### What Does It Manage?

This system tracks inventory for **all KJSIT departments**:

1. **Computer Engineering** - Desktops, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.
2. **Information Technology** - Laptops, routers, software licenses
3. **AI & Data Science** - GPU workstations, IoT sensors, ML software
4. **Electronics & Telecom** - Oscilloscopes, signal generators, multimeters
5. **Basic Sciences** - Microscopes, chemicals, lab equipment
6. **Administration** - Office furniture, printers, stationery
7. **Student Facilities** - Library books, sports equipment, loanable laptops

**Total**: 80+ items across 10 categories!

### Who Uses It?

**Admin** (Full Access):
- Manage all inventory
- Add/edit/delete items
- Approve/reject all requests
- View complete statistics

**Staff** (Department Access):
- Manage department inventory
- Approve/reject student requests
- View pending requests
- Add/edit items

**Student** (Request Access):
- View all available items
- Request item checkout
- View own borrowing history
- See request status

### How Does It Work?

1. **Student** searches inventory and requests an item
2. **Staff/Admin** sees pending request on dashboard
3. **Staff/Admin** approves or rejects request
4. If approved, **item quantity automatically decreases** (via database trigger!)
5. When returned, **quantity increases back**
6. System tracks complete history
