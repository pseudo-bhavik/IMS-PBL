## Detailed Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- **Faculty Role Added**: New role between staff and student with appropriate permissions
- **User Management**: Updated all authentication logic to support 4 roles
- **Permission Hierarchy**:
  - **Admin**: Full access - can add/edit/delete items, approve requests, generate reports
  - **Staff**: Can edit items, approve requests for their department
  - **Faculty**: Can request items (borrow/issue), view inventory
  - **Student**: Can request items (borrow only), view inventory

#### 2. Borrowable/Issuable System
- **Item Flags**: Every item has `isBorrowable` and `isIssuable` properties
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded badges show item availability type:
  - Blue badge: "BORROWABLE" (temporary checkout)
  - Purple badge: "ISSUABLE" (permanent assignment)
- **Sample Data**: 32 items configured with various combinations:
  - Some items are borrowable only (e.g., Library Books)
  - Some items are issuable only (e.g., Software Licenses)
  - Some items are both (e.g., Laptops, Arduino Kits)
  - Some items are neither (e.g., Office Furniture)

#### 3. Admin-Only Item Creation
- **Add Button**: Only visible to admin users
- **Permission Check**: Staff can no longer create new items
- **Edit Access**: Staff can still edit existing items in their department
- **Delete Access**: Only admin can delete items

#### 4. Quantity Management
- **Dual Tracking**: System tracks both quantities:
  - `totalQuantity`: Total number of items that exist
  - `quantity`: Currently available quantity
- **Display Format**: Shows as "Available / Total" (e.g., "50/60")
- **Admin Control**: Both quantities can be modified independently by admin/staff
- **Stock Status**:
  - **Out of Stock**: quantity = 0
  - **Low Stock**: quantity ‚â§ 20% of total
  - **Available**: quantity > 20% of total

#### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- **SVG Logo**: Custom red and white logo on:
  - Login page (animated entrance)
  - All navigation headers (smaller version)
- **Header Layout**:
  - Logo + title on the left
  - Navigation links in center
  - User info + logout button on the right (grouped in styled container)
- **User Display**: Shows name and role separately with better formatting
- **Logout Button**: Styled button with hover effects instead of plain link

#### 6. Dashboard Enhancements
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Total Items count
  - Total Quantity sum
  - Available Quantity
  - Low Stock Items
  - Out of Stock Items
  - Pending Requests
- **Staff Dashboard**:
  - Pending Requests
  - Approved Today
  - Low Stock Items
  - Out of Stock Items
- **Faculty Dashboard**:
  - My Pending Requests
  - My Approved Requests
  - Items Issued to Me
  - Available Items
- **Student Dashboard**:
  - My Pending Requests
  - My Approved Requests
  - Available Items
  - Total Items

#### 7. Data Structure Updates
- **Users**: Added faculty user with department assignment
- **Items**: All 32 items have borrowable/issuable flags
- **Transactions**: Updated with transaction type (borrow/issue)
- **Damage Reports**: Sample data for testing (3 reports)
- **Issued Items**: Sample data for permanent issuances (2 items)

### üöß Features Ready for Implementation (When Database is Available)

The following features have been designed and have supporting data structures, but require database persistence:

#### 1. Damage/Loss Reporting
- **Data Structure**: `DAMAGE_REPORTS` array in mock data
- **Fields**: Type, severity, description, estimated cost, status
- **Workflow**: Report ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Repair/Replace ‚Üí Resolved
- **UI**: Modal form ready to be implemented

#### 2. Report Generation (PDF/Excel)
- **Requirements**: Export functionality for:
  - Inventory by category
  - Inventory by department
  - Transaction history
  - Low stock reports
  - User borrowing history
- **Implementation**: Requires PDF library (jsPDF) and Excel library (SheetJS)

#### 3. Analytics Dashboard with Charts
- **Metrics Identified**:
  - Monthly borrowing trends
  - Department-wise usage
  - Category popularity
  - Stock level timeline
- **Implementation**: Requires charting library (Chart.js or similar)

#### 4. Issuance Workflow
- **Current State**: Data structure exists, transactions marked as 'issue' type
- **Needs**: Separate UI flow for permanent issuance vs temporary borrow
- **Features**: Due dates, return tracking for issued items

### üìù Database Schema Design

Complete Supabase migration file created with:
- All tables with proper relationships
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Indexes for performance
- Views for reporting
- Ready to deploy when database connection is available

2. **Implement Damage Reporting UI**: Modal form with file upload for images
3. **Add Report Generation**: Integrate jsPDF and SheetJS libraries
4. **Create Analytics Charts**: Add Chart.js and implement visualizations

### Medium Priority
5. **Separate Issuance Flow**: Different UI for borrow vs issue requests
6. **Email Notifications**: Alert users on request status changes
7. **Search Optimization**: Add debouncing and better filters
8. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test and fix on smaller screens

### Low Priority
9. **Print Functionality**: Add print stylesheets
